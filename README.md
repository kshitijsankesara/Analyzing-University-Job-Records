# Analyzing University Job Records


For my IST 652: Scripting for Data Analysis course, I analyzed the Indian University Job records which were uploaded on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement). The data records the college placement (job) history and includes variables like student’s salary, gender, marks, and some other relevant data. My goal in this project is to better analyze their college placement data to understand the variables affecting salary and job placements. I’m analyzing the factors which have a positive or a negative impact on salary and job placements. There were a total of **15 attributes.**

**Data Cleaning:**
1. Converted JSON data file to pandas dataframe
2. Removed one attribute
3. Checked for null and missing values
4. Renamed all the columns

**Data Exploration:**
1. Perform descriptive and statistical analysis
2. Build correlation graphs to understand the relation between variables
3. Build multiple visualizations to understand the data

After exploring the data, I answered various important business questions to understand the data properly.

**Business Questions:**
1. Which HSC stream gets the most salary?
2. Which degree stream students are the most paid?
3. How important is work experience?
4. How important is Specialization?
5. Which students have a higher chance of getting placed?

**Language: Python**

**Visualizations: Distribution Graphs, Scatter Plots, Line Graphs, Correlation Matrix**

**Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy**
